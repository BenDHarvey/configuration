** TODO Sort out the mail issues

[[file:~/.configuration/nix/modules/mail.nix::{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:]]

There are currently some issues with this mail config. When trying to run the ~mbsync -a~ command we get an error

Example of the error:

** TODO Tweak the yabai config

[[file:~/.configuration/nix/modules/mac/wm.nix::{config, pkgs, ...}:]]

Have been looking at getting this config working correctly. It installs fine and can confirm that yabai is working. Need to put some work into getting the keybindings working correctly. There are some bindings in the config that I grabbed but they are not quiet what I am used to.

Some resources that I used to get things working:
-  https://github.com/heywoodlh/nixos-builds/blob/master/darwin/wm.nix
- https://cmacr.ae/post/2020-05-13-yabai-module-in-nix-darwin-now-generally-available/

This is a good start but still needs some tweaking
