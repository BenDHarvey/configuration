** TODO this is not working.... investigate why

[[file:~/.configuration/nix/modules/home/linux/home.nix::home.file.".local/share/rofi/themes/base16-dracula.rasi".source =]]

** TODO Recreate the secrets dir

Looks like the secrets directory got lost at some point. Find this and recreate so that some of this config works

** TODO Setup the yabai window manager

[[file:~/.configuration/nix/darwin-configuration.nix::TODO: Add config for yabai window manager. See todo.org for details]]

Have already found some config that should work for this. At the moment yabai is not compiling correctly. Suspect this might have something to do with being on m1
