** TODO Tweak the yabai config

[[file:~/.configuration/nix/modules/mac/wm.nix::{config, pkgs, ...}:]]

Have been looking at getting this config working correctly. It installs fine and can confirm that yabai is working. Need to put some work into getting the keybindings working correctly. There are some bindings in the config that I grabbed but they are not quiet what I am used to.

Some resources that I used to get things working:
-  https://github.com/heywoodlh/nixos-builds/blob/master/darwin/wm.nix
- https://cmacr.ae/post/2020-05-13-yabai-module-in-nix-darwin-now-generally-available/

This is a good start but still needs some tweaking

** TODO this is not working.... investigate why

** TODO Recreate the secrets dir

Looks like the secrets directory got lost at some point. Find this and recreate so that some of this config works
